# odin-recipes
This is my first HTML project and I'm following the Odin Project foundations guidelines (https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes).

The main objective here is to present a recipes website with a few different pages; upload the repository on github; practice using the cmd line and; make use of the commit messages.
